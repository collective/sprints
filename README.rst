=============
Plone sprints
=============

Keep up with Plone sprints one *rst* file at a time.


Rationale
=========

Have you ever participate in a sprint working on a specific thing,
left it unfinished and get to know later on that someone else is working on it **from scratch**?

**No longer!**


How it works
============

Whenever you create a sprint,
please,
create a new file in this repository.

File name format should be like: ``YYYY-MM-DD-SPRINT-NAME.rst``

Where the timestamp is the sprint starting date.


File template
=============

For the lazy ones, here is a template proposal to reuse, enhancements welcome:

    ===========
    SPRINT NAME
    ===========
    
    Short description of the sprint, its focus/goals...
    
    Dates and location
    ==================
    
    Brief information about where and when it happened/is happening
    
    Participants
    ============
    
    List of @names of all participants, so is easier to find them later on.
    
    Links
    =====
    
    Links to coactivate, or other pages with information related to the sprint
    
    Topics
    ======
    
    List of topics that where sprinted during the sprint with a @names list of who was involved on each of them.
    Links to GitHub issues or packages worked on and so on.
