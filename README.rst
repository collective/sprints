=============
Plone sprints
=============

Keep up with Plone sprints one *rst* file at a time.


Rationale
=========

Have you ever participate in a sprint working on a specific thing,
left it unfinished and get to know later on that someone else is working on it **from scratch**?

**No longer!**


How it works
============

Whenever you create a sprint,
please,
create a new file in this repository.

File name format should be like: ``YYYY-MM-DD-SPRINT-NAME.rst``

Where the timestamp is the sprint starting date.


File template
=============

For the lazy ones, copy the template found at ``2020-01-01-TEMPLATE.rst``.
